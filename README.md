# Physical-Simulation

Rigid body simulation involves modeling and simulating the motion of solid objects that maintain their shape and size, even when subjected to external forces and torques. Here, I implement a simple rigid body simulation using Python and Taichi. Taichi is a high-performance programming language designed for numerical computing and machine learning
